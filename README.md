This is a basic gathering/farming script made for QB-Core to give a certain amount of items to a player after he interacts on one of the gathering locations.

**Features :** 
- Localisable
- Extensive configuration file
- Multiple gathering locations

You can also copy/paste the folder and rename it to create a new type of farming/gathering location (since everything is configurable in config.lua)
